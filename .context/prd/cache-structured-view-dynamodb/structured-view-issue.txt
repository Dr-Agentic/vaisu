Issue #2: Structured View is not stored in the dynamodb. A new LLM request is placed each time.

Description:
The structured-view visualization is recalculated on every request instead of being cached in DynamoDB. This results in a full LLM round‑trip for each request, which is inefficient in terms of compute cost and latency.

Details from the logs:
- POST http://localhost:7001/api/documents/eb73fd25-57d1-4a44-9443-9a8928b95ed8/visualizations/structured-view
- The system traces a full reconstruction of the document from DynamoDB, followed by generation of a new structured-view visualization each time.
- The LLM invocation occurs repeatedly, producing the same structured‑view output.

Impact:
- Unnecessary LLM token consumption and cost.
- Slower response times for users.
- Redundant processing of the same visualization.

Suggested mitigation:
- Store the generated structured‑view result in DynamoDB after the first successful generation.
- Keep the result as an entry in the DynamoDB table using a suitable key (e.g., document ID). No TTL is needed; the entry persists until manually cleared or versioned.
- On subsequent requests, check the DynamoDB table first; if an entry exists, return it directly without invoking the LLM again.

This change would eliminate the repeated LLM calls and significantly improve performance for the structured‑view feature.
