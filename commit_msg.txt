feat: Implement User Management UI and Redesign MindMap

User Management System:
- **Frontend UI**: Implemented full suite of authentication pages (Login, Register, Forgot/Reset Password, Verify Email).
- **Profile Management**: Created Profile Dashboard with personal details, password update, active session management, and account deletion ("Danger Zone").
- **State Management**: Implemented userStore using Zustand for persistent authentication state.
- **API Integration**: Updated apiClient to support all auth-related endpoints.
- **Navigation**: Added UserMenu component for easy access to profile and logout.

MindMap Redesign:
- **Architecture**: Refactored single-file component into a feature module (components/visualizations/mind-map/) with dedicated stores, hooks, and utils.
- **Layout Engine**: Implemented useMindMapLayout hook featuring a deterministic **Columnar Grid Layout** where hierarchy levels map to fixed columns, ensuring a clean and readable structure.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Added logic to initially show only the top 3 levels. Clicking a node now expands the next 2 levels of its branch, reducing cognitive load.
- **Visuals**: 
  - Integrated GraphEntityCard for consistent node rendering (badges, importance indicators).
  - Integrated DynamicBezierPath for smooth edge connections.
  - Added **"Aurora Effect"** (teal glow) to highlight the direct descendants of the selected node.
- **State Management**: Introduced mindMapStore (Zustand) to handle graph data, selection state, and expansion logic.

Fixes & Polish:
- **Linting**: Resolved critical lint errors in frontend pages, including duplicate props in Login/Profile forms and synchronous state logic in VerifyEmail.
- **Backend Types**: Updated User interface in userRepository.ts to include profilePictureUrl and role to match API usage.
- **Frontend Build**: 
  - Fixed template literal syntax error in dataTransformers.ts.
  - Corrected JSX structure in DocumentBrowserPanel.tsx.
  - Added missing color property to GraphNode type definition.
  - Cleaned up unused imports and fixed module resolution paths in visualization components.
- **Verification**: Confirmed successful build for both server and client.
