# Go‑to‑Market (GTM) Plan – From Customer #1 to $1 M ARR  
*(Tailored to Vaisu – Text‑to‑Visual‑Intelligence)*  

---  

## 1️⃣ Define the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)  

| Segment | Who they are | Why they feel the pain | How Vaisu helps | Typical budget |
|---------|--------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Boutique law firms / compliance teams** | 5‑30 lawyers handling contracts, TOS, privacy policies | Spending dozens of hours reading dense legal docs; risk of missing obligations | TL;DR + mind‑map that surfaces key clauses, obligations, device limits in seconds | $2‑5 k / yr per lawyer (enterprise‑level licensing) |
| **Strategy/management consultants** | 10‑50 analysts preparing market reports, earnings‑call decks | Need fast synthesis of research papers, earnings releases, market studies for client presentations | Executive‑summary + dashboard visualisations that can be exported to PPTX/PDF | $1‑3 k / yr per analyst (team seat) |
| **R&D / scientific groups** | Pharma, biotech, academic labs reading dozens of papers, patents | Mapping findings, tracking method‑relationships, building timelines for grant proposals | Knowledge‑graph + timeline visualisations; export to SVG/PPTX for reports | $1‑2 k / yr per researcher |
| **Finance / equity analysts** | Investment firms parsing SEC filings, earnings releases | Rapid extraction of KPIs, risk factors, scenario pathways | Flow‑chart / dashboard of financial metrics, KPIs, risk tags | $2‑4 k / yr per analyst |

**First‑customer target:** A mid‑size boutique law firm (≈8‑12 attorneys) that spends >200 hrs/month reviewing contracts.

## 2️⃣ Value Proposition & Pricing Scaffold  

| Tier | Target | Core Features | Monthly Price (per seat) | Annual ARR (if fully booked) |
|------|--------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Starter** | Solo consultants / small firms (1‑5 seats) | Unlimited docs, 3 visual types, PDF/PNG export, basic support | **$15** | $180 k (12 mo) |
| **Professional** | 5‑20 seats (law firms, consultancies) | All visual types, API access, SSO, priority support, custom visual templates | **$45** | $1.08 M (24 mo) |
| **Enterprise** | Large corporates, legal‑ops, R&D departments | Dedicated inference pool, white‑label branding, SLA, on‑premise/private‑cloud deployment, audit logs | **$120** (or custom) + $0.02 per extra visualisation | $5 M+ (depends on seat count) |
| **Add‑ons** | – | Premium visual templates, brand‑kit, extra LLM credits, on‑premise container | $500‑$2 k / yr | — |

**$1 M Milestone** can be reached by:  

- **Option A:** 22 Enterprise seats @ $120 /mo × 12 mo ≈ **$31 k / mo** → **$372 k / yr**. Add 30 Professional seats @ $45 /mo → **$13.5 k / mo** → **$162 k / yr**. Combined ≈ **$534 k** ARR.  
- **Option B:** Reach **≈833 Starter** users at $15 /mo → **$1 M** ARR.  
- **Fastest path:** Land **5‑10 Enterprise contracts** (average $15 k / yr each) → $75‑150 k ARR, then scale to 60‑70 seats across tiers to cross $1 M within 12‑18 months.

| 3 | 3 × Starter (3 × $15 × 12) = $540 | $540 | Early‑adopter pilots convert |
| 6 | 10 × Professional ($45 × 12) = $5.4 k /mo → $64.8 k ARR | $65.3 k | Add 2 enterprise pilots ($15 k each) → $30 k |
| 9 | 25 × Professional → $135 k ARR; 1 × Enterprise ($15 k) → $15 k | $210 k | Content & ad campaigns ramp |
| 12 | 50 × Professional → $270 k; 3 × Enterprise → $45 k; 100 × Starter → $180 k | **$450 k** | Hit $0.5 M, begin sales‑machine |

## 8️⃣ Success‑Factor Mitigations (from earlier counter‑argument)  

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Narrow audience / high switching cost | Focus on **one vertical** (e.g., boutique law firms) → build a deep reference case → leverage for adjacent firms. |
| Low willingness‑to‑pay for visualisation alone | Tie every visualisation to a **measurable ROI** (hours saved → dollar saved). Use the ROI calculator as the core selling tool. |
| LLM cost & accuracy | Cache frequent TL;DR results; use cheaper models for routine docs and higher‑end models only when confidence is low; embed audit logs for compliance. |
| Customer acquisition & retention cost | Start with **referral & content** loops; use targeted LinkedIn ads; maintain low‑touch onboarding; drive upsell via usage metrics. |
| Competitive moat thinness | Pursue **data‑privacy/on‑premise** deployment, custom visual templates, and industry‑specific compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). |
| Macro threats (regulations, big‑tech bundling) | Build **explainability & audit trail** from day‑one; differentiate with **specialised visual types** and **partner integrations**. |

---  

### Next Steps  

1. **Finalize the GTM Plan** – review with stakeholders, lock in pricing tiers.  
2. **Build the ROI Calculator** (simple web tool) and embed it on a landing page.  
3. **Launch the Early‑Adopter Program** – recruit 5‑8 pilot customers, sign pilot‑to‑paid contracts.  
4. **Create Core Marketing Assets** – case study, webinar, blog post, LinkedIn ad creatives.  
5. **Set Up Tracking** – analytics for leads, demo‑to‑paid conversion, usage metrics; feed into the financial model.  

With disciplined execution of this plan, Vaisu can move from a single pilot to a sustainable business generating **$1 M+ ARR** within 12‑18 months.
