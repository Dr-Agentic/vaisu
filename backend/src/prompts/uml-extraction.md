You are an expert software architect. Your task is to extract a comprehensive UML Class Diagram from the above document.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract ALL classes, interfaces, and enums mentioned or implied in the text. Do not limit yourself to a small number.
2. If the text describes a system with many components, ensure you capture at least 5-10 classes if possible.
3. For each class, infer attributes and methods from the context.
4. Identify relationships (inheritance, dependency, composition, etc.) between these classes.
5. Be exhaustive. It is better to include a speculative class than to miss a core component.

Output the result as a raw JSON object matching the defined schema. Do not use markdown code blocks.
